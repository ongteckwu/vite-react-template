## Process

1. Think step-by-step, laying out assumptions and unknowns.
2. Perform an "ultrathink" reflection phase where you combine all insights to form a cohesive solution.
3. Create a TODO.md with the todo plan created.

## Output Format

1. **Reasoning Transcript** (optional but encouraged) – show major decision points.
2. **Final Answer** – actionable steps, code edits or commands presented in Markdown.
3. **Next Actions** – bullet list of follow-up items for the team (if any).
